# 💼 Salary Distribution Contract

## 📘 Project Description
The **Salary Distribution Contract** is a smart contract written in Solidity to automate employee salary disbursement using Ethereum. It enables an employer to manage employees and send regular salaries without intermediaries or manual transfers.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To offer a transparent, secure, and decentralized payroll system that simplifies employee payments and enhances trust through blockchain technology.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 👤 **Owner-only Access**: Only the contract owner can manage employees and initiate salary payments.
- 📥 **Employee Registry**: Add, update, and remove employee wallet addresses and their respective salaries.
- 💸 **Bulk Salary Transfer**: Automatically transfer salaries to all registered employees in one go.
- 🧾 **On-chain Records**: Transparent logs with employee data and balance tracking.
- 🔐 **No External Libraries**: Built entirely from scratch without OpenZeppelin or any third-party dependencies.

## 🔭 Future Scope
- 💱 **Token Integration**: Enable stablecoin-based salary payments (like USDT or DAI).
- 📆 **Scheduled Payouts**: Add automated monthly distribution using blockchain oracles (like Chainlink Keepers).
- 📊 **Dashboard UI**: Build a web3 frontend to interact with the contract and visualize employee data.
- 👥 **Role Management**: Allow HR and finance roles with limited permissions.
- 📄 **Audit Logs**: Record and retrieve salary history per employee.
